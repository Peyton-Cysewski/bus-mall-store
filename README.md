# bus-mall-store

This project is meant to replicate an online store with various products. The user can choose what item and how many to add to a cart. This cart is saved in local storage so it persists across html pages. The current functionality on the checkout page only allows the user to remove items from the cart.

The stretch goals that I was not able to implement were: having a checkout form that would simulate an order with address and contact info, animations with pop-up messages saying that the order was confirmed, and ultra-clean styling.
